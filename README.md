# Big-Data
Here I code various Big-Data Technologies. Below I take you through my journey starting from MPI
1) MPI- Message Passing Interface. I use mpi4py to perform parallel computing. Some basic operations like Vector Addition, Matrix Vector Multiplication and Matrix Multiplication is carried out
2) MPI framework to process large natural language corpora. some basic tasks in NLP including data cleaning, text tokenization and convert words into their Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) scores are done on the Twenty Newsgroup Dataset.
3) We then move to implement Distrubed K-Means Clustering on the Twenty-Newsgroup Dataset with K as a Hyperparameter.
4) Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD) Implementation using MPI.
5) Next, we move to Hadoop. Some Map-Reduce concepts are implemented on Movie-Lens Dataset.
6) Le-Net Architecture is implented on MNIST and CIFAR-10 Datasets using PyTorch. Visualisation is done on Tensorboard.
7) Various Network Analysis is performed on the Image Clasification Network Like Normalization, Regularization, Different Optimizer Selection.
8) Apache Spark
9) Finally, PSGD and HogWild Implementations are carried out on PyTorch using custom Neural Net Architecture.

Hope you enjoy looking through these implementations!!!!
